## 1. What is the Big O for this?

1. This is a constant time algorithm O(1).

2. This is a linear time algorithm O(n).

## 2. Even or odd
This algorithm runs on a constant time complexity O(1) because no matter the size of the data we input,
it will always return one value.

## 3. Are you here?
This is an algorithm that runs on Polynomial time O(n^2). If we double the input data, we quadruple the running time.
The time complexity increases its growth depending on the input size.

## 4. Doubler
This is a linear time algorithm O(n) because the run time is directly proportional to the size of the input. 

## 5. Naive Search
This is also a linear time algorithm O(n) because the run time is directly proportional to the size of the input.

## 6. Creating pairs
This is a Polynomial time algorithm O(n^2) because for each input, we double the running time.
The time complexity increases its growth depending on the input size.

## 7. Compute the sequence
This is a linear time algorithm O(n) because we are given a random sized dataset that will influence the running time
depending on the input size.

## 8. An efficient search
This is a logarithmic time algorithm O(log(n)) because we cut the input size in half and it will take fewer operations to run.
Therefore, the bigger the input, the smaller proportion of the actual input your program has to run.

## 9. Random element
This is a constant time algorithm O(1) because no matter the size of the input, it will always take the same amount of time
to complete.

## 10. What Am I?
This is a linear time algorithm O(n) because the run times are directly proportional to the input size.
